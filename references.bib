abstract="We present a multi-input encoder-decoder neural network model able to perform MR image synthesis from any subset of its inputs, outperforming prior methods in both single and multi-input settings. This is achieved by encouraging the network to learn a modality invariant latent embedding during training. We demonstrate that a spatial transformer module [7] can be included in our model to automatically correct misalignment in the input data. Thus, our model is robust both to missing and misaligned data at test time. Finally, we show that the model's modular nature allows transfer learning to different datasets.",
